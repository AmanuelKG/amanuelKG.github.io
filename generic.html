									<h1>about me<br />
									</h1>
									<p>My educational background is a bachelorâ€™s degree in statistics and computer science. I was graduated in 2007 and worked as a statistician and data analyst in the Eritrean National Statistics office from July 2006 to October 2011.</p>

								<p>While at the Eritrean National Statistics office, I worked on several quantitative research projects from designing questioners for data collection purposes (data is now available at our fingertip because of the advancement of the internet), designing data entry platform using Cspro, batch cleaning and making data ready for analysis. Finally, exporting the data to statistical analysis software SPSS and Excel and analyzing the data and then successfully compiled the quantitative research findings for stakeholders or other research team members. I loved what I do and when the office was hard hit with a shortage of statistics graduates, I successfully supervised and trained our staff from vocational schools, statistics, and data entry and processing courses to combat the shortage and maintain efficiency and scalability by delegating tasks. In 2011 I left Eritrean National statistics office and Eritrea, and with former University of Asmara alumni and Eritrean National Statistics colleagues established an investment consulting firm in Juba South-Sudan. After a year and a half successful move, the situation was not favorable for our business venture and I shifted to another merchandize and hotel industry in which I worked as a general manager. As a general manager, I was tasked more with the hotel and hospitality subsidiary and managed to save Acropole Hotel from closure and created the momentum to have a very competitive market share in Juba and was one of the few UN Mosses Compliant Hotels until I leave in 2016.</p>
								<p>I moved to the United States in 2016 and since I set foot in the USA, I worked relentlesly to continue my passionate career in Data Science, and using different Educational platforms such as Coursera, Udemy, I worked hard to come to shape, And finally, enrolled into a Data Science Apprenticeship Bootcamp with Thinkful and alongside an experienced mentor and technical coaches I managed to successfully build hands-on several analytical projects and machine learning solutions. My previous knowledge and experience in statistics helped me to coupe up with ease and have a deeper understanding of the underlying analytics procedures and algorisms and evaluation metrics. I am currently working in PG&E Headquarters (SFGO) in San Francisco as a Security Supervisor with G4S Secure Solutions.</p>
